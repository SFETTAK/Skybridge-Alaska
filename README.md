## What's In It For YOU as a Pilot?

### 🎯 **You'll Never Miss Critical Radio Calls Again**
You know that sinking feeling when you realize you missed THE critical weather report or traffic advisory that was said once when you were out of range. With SkyBridge, Alaska DOT&PF base stations capture every VHF transmission and send it to your phone as text. **You'll always know what was said.**

### 📱 **Everything on Your Phone or Tablet**  
No new expensive avionics to buy or learn. The SkyBridge app runs on the iPhone or Android device you already carry. Your phone becomes your complete aviation services portal.

### 💰 **You Pay Once, Use Forever**
$50 for the [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org) radio, then you're done. No monthly subscriptions, no satellite fees, no corporate overlords bleeding you dry. **Your radio, your network, your control.**

### 🔒 **You Control What You Share**
Share your location if you want, keep it private if you don't. Share weather reports to help other pilots, or just receive information. **The network works for you, not against you.**

### 🌐 **Your Network Gets Stronger with More Pilots**
Every pilot who joins makes coverage better for everyone. More reliability, more safety, more information. You're not just buying a radio - **you're joining a community that has each other's backs.**

## The Problem We're Solving

**The aviation crisis is real and deadly:** As [The Washington Post](https://www.adn.com/aviation/article/alaska-s-outdated-maps-make-flying-peril-high-tech-fix-gaining-ground/2014/10/15/) reported, terrain mapping errors of 263+ feet contributed to fatal crashes, with one expert noting *"Mars is better mapped than the state of Alaska."* Traditional government solutions remain stuck in budget gridlock after decades.

**SkyBridge is the breakthrough:** A $50 peer-to-peer solution that bypasses failed government infrastructure.

### The Crisis Behind the Solution (Validated by The Washington Post, CDC, NTSB)
- **Alaska pilots are 36x more likely to die** than the average US worker *(CDC)*
- **Terrain maps contain errors up to 263+ feet** - directly contributing to fatal crashes *(Washington Post investigation)*
- **15 "controlled flight into terrain" crashes since 2008** killed 16 people, left 7 seriously injured *(NTSB)*
- **No reliable weather/NOTAM updates** in remote areas covering 80% of Alaska
- **Government mapping solutions stuck in budget gridlock** - $30M needed just to finish Alaska *(Washington Post)*
- **"Mars is better mapped than the state of Alaska"** - Steve Colligan, E-Terra Aviation Safety

## How It Works

SkyBridge is a **mobile app and web platform** for Alaska aviation services that **works anywhere, even in the sky** using a simple $50 [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org) radio that plugs into aircraft power.

**Simple setup:** Install the app, plug in the radio, and your phone becomes your complete aviation services portal - **no cell towers or satellites required.**

### Technology Stack
- **Hardware**: Affordable LoRa radios available from multiple vendors
- **Protocol**: NASA TAIGA ASN.1 for efficient data compression  
- **Network**: [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org) open-source mesh networking - **proven technology used worldwide**

### For State Aviation Officials

**Why SkyBridge Matters to Your State:**
- 🏔️ **Rural aviation challenges aren't unique to Alaska** - Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado face similar terrain and weather risks
- 💰 **$50 nodes vs $200K ground stations** - Economically viable for rural airports and pilot communities  
- 🏛️ **State control, not federal dependency** - Community-operated infrastructure under state oversight
- 📈 **Revenue potential** - Commercial licensing funds ongoing development while keeping core system open source
- 🤝 **Interstate cooperation** - Shared development costs, shared safety benefits

**Advanced Integration Capabilities:**
- **All-in-one radio solution** - [Rokland Technologies](https://rokland.com) partnership developing VHF/ADS-B/SDR/LoRa combination units
- **Aircraft systems integration** - CANBUS/OBD2/Aero-CAN connectivity for automated reporting
- **Base station VHF transcription** - Ground stations automatically convert radio chatter to text and distribute via [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org) mesh
- **Multi-agency support** - RWIS highway weather, UAF Volcanic Institute, USGS seismic networks all supported

**Ready for Multi-State Pilot Program**
- Working [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org) prototypes deployed and tested
