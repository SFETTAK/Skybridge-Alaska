## Technical Validation from Partnerships

### Meshtastic Range Capabilities
Based on official Meshtastic range tests documented at [meshtastic.org](https://meshtastic.org/docs/overview/range-tests/):

#### **Current Ground Record: 331km (205 miles)**
- **Hardware**: RAK4631 Core with optimized antennas
- **Settings**: Very Long Slow (SF12, 62.5kHz bandwidth)
- **Conditions**: Ground-to-ground with line-of-sight

#### **Current Air Record: 206km (128 miles)**
- **Hardware**: LILYGO T-Beam with stock antennas
- **Settings**: Long Fast (SF11, 250kHz bandwidth)
- **Conditions**: Ground-to-air with balloon testing

### SkyBridge Aviation Advantages
**At altitude, SkyBridge can exceed these records because:**
- **Line-of-sight geometry**: Aircraft at 5,000+ feet have extended radio horizon
- **Reduced ground clutter**: Less interference from terrain and structures
- **Optimized antennas**: Aviation-specific antenna configurations
- **900MHz propagation**: Excellent performance through weather conditions

## Partnership Benefits for Multi-State Deployment

### **Technical Support**
- **Firmware customization** for aviation-specific protocols
- **Hardware optimization** for Alaska's harsh environmental conditions
- **Performance testing** and validation support
- **Integration assistance** with existing aviation systems

### **Commercial Advantages**
