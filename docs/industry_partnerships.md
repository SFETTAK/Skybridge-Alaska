# SkyBridge Industry Partnerships
*Strategic Relationships with Key Technology Partners*

## Active Partnership Discussions

SkyBridge has established direct relationships with the core technology providers that make the system possible, demonstrating industry confidence and support for the project.

### Meshtastic Partnership
**Contact**: Ben Meadors, Tony G - Meshtastic Foundation  
**Status**: Active discussions, scheduled technical calls  
**Partnership Value**:
- **Core firmware development** support for aviation-specific features
- **Technical expertise** for mesh optimization and protocol enhancement
- **Community backing** from the open-source Meshtastic ecosystem
- **Development roadmap alignment** for aviation use cases

### Rokland Technologies Partnership
**Contact**: Jason Opdyke - [Rokland Technologies](https://rokland.com)  
**Status**: Multiple technical calls, ongoing collaboration discussions  
**Partnership Value**:
- **Integrated radio development** - Combining VHF, ADS-B, SDR, and LoRa in single unit
- **Aviation-specific hardware** - Ruggedized installations for Alaska conditions
- **All-in-one cockpit solution** - Single radio handles all communication needs
- **Supply chain partnership** - Scaled deployment and technical support

**Planned Integration:**
- **VHF transceiver integration** - Eliminate need for separate aviation radios
- **ADS-B receiver built-in** - Native traffic awareness without external devices
- **SDR capabilities** - Software-defined radio for flexible frequency support
- **Single antenna solution** - Simplified aircraft installation

## Technical Validation from Partnerships

### Meshtastic Range Capabilities
Based on official Meshtastic range tests documented at [meshtastic.org](https://meshtastic.org/docs/overview/range-tests/):

#### **Current Ground Record: 331km (205 miles)**
- **Hardware**: RAK4631 Core with optimized antennas
- **Settings**: Very Long Slow (SF12, 62.5kHz bandwidth)
- **Conditions**: Ground-to-ground with line-of-sight

#### **Current Air Record: 206km (128 miles)**
- **Hardware**: LILYGO T-Beam with stock antennas
- **Settings**: Long Fast (SF11, 250kHz bandwidth)
- **Conditions**: Ground-to-air with balloon testing

### SkyBridge Aviation Advantages
**At altitude, SkyBridge can exceed these records because:**
- **Line-of-sight geometry**: Aircraft at 5,000+ feet have extended radio horizon
- **Reduced ground clutter**: Less interference from terrain and structures
- **Optimized antennas**: Aviation-specific antenna configurations
- **900MHz propagation**: Excellent performance through weather conditions

## Partnership Benefits for Multi-State Deployment

### **Technical Support**
- **Firmware customization** for aviation-specific protocols
- **Hardware optimization** for Alaska's harsh environmental conditions
- **Performance testing** and validation support
- **Integration assistance** with existing aviation systems

### **Commercial Advantages**
- **Preferred pricing** for bulk hardware procurement
- **Priority support** for deployment and troubleshooting
- **Co-marketing opportunities** for aviation market penetration
- **Joint development** of aviation-specific product variants

### **Credibility Enhancement**
- **Industry validation** from established technology companies
- **Technical backing** from open-source community leaders
- **Partnership announcements** for media and stakeholder confidence
- **Reference implementations** for other aviation deployments
