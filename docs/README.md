# SkyBridge Alaska - Documentation

This directory contains technical references, analysis documents, and presentation materials for the SkyBridge Alaska project.

## Core Technical Documentation

### [TAIGA_ASN1_Reference.pdf](TAIGA_ASN1_Reference.pdf)
Official NASA Technical Memorandum (NASA/TMâ€”2015-218427) describing the TAIGA ASN.1 protocol for efficient aviation data encoding. This document provides the technical foundation for SkyBridge's 80% data compression capability.

**Key Features:**
- 80% compression vs raw text for aviation weather data
- Supports PIREPs, METARs, NOTAMs, weather polygons
- Packed Encoding Rules (PER) for minimal bandwidth
- Real-world examples with Alaska aviation data

## Project Analysis & Validation

### [alaska_aviation_gap_analysis_summary.md](alaska_aviation_gap_analysis_summary.md)
Summary of the official Alaska DOT&PF Aviation Gap Analysis (March 2024) that validates SkyBridge's mission with comprehensive state data on infrastructure failures, economic barriers, and specific recommendations.

### [media_coverage.md](media_coverage.md)
Key statistics and quotes from The Washington Post investigation into Alaska's aviation crisis, including the Stack/Beane crash analysis and expert testimonials.

### [existing_solutions_analysis.md](existing_solutions_analysis.md)
Analysis of Alaska's Enhanced Special Reporting Service (eSRS) and how it validates SkyBridge's mission. Shows government acknowledgment of infrastructure gaps and market demand for communication alternatives.

## Presentation Materials

### [elevator_pitch.md](elevator_pitch.md)
Complete presentation materials for state aviation officials, including:
- 30-second and 60-second elevator pitches
- Key statistics to memorize
- Compelling quotes from media coverage
- Answers to common questions
- Target state priorities

## Visual Assets

### Network Diagrams
- `network.jpg` - Network topology overview
- `SDR-Mesh-GeneralAviation.png` - Aviation-specific mesh network diagram

These images illustrate how SkyBridge creates resilient peer-to-peer networks that continue operating even when individual nodes fail.

## Using This Documentation

**For Technical Audiences:**
Start with the NASA TAIGA reference and technical architecture documents.

**For State Officials:**
Review the Gap Analysis summary and elevator pitch materials for policy context.

**For Media/Public:**
Use the media coverage document for credible statistics and expert quotes.

**For Developers:**
The TAIGA protocol specification provides implementation details for data compression and message formatting.
