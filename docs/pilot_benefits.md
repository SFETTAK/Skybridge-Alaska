# Why Pilots Choose SkyBridge
*Direct Benefits for General Aviation Pilots*

## What SkyBridge Means for YOU

### Never Miss Critical Radio Calls Again
You know that sinking feeling when you realize you missed THE critical weather report or traffic advisory that was said once when you were out of range. With SkyBridge, Alaska DOT&PF base stations capture every VHF transmission and send it to your phone as text. You'll always know what was said.

### You Pay Once, Use Forever  
$50 for the [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org) radio, then you're done. No monthly subscriptions, no satellite fees, no corporate overlords bleeding you dry. Your radio, your network, your control.

### You Control What You Share
Your privacy is sacred. Share your location if you want, keep it private if you don't. Share weather reports to help other pilots, or just receive information. The network works for you, not against you.

### Everything on Your Phone or Tablet
No new expensive avionics to buy or learn. No complicated installations. The SkyBridge app runs on the iPhone or Android device you already carry. Everything you need in one familiar interface.

### Your Network Gets Stronger
Every pilot who joins makes the network better for everyone. More coverage, more reliability, more safety. You're not just buying a radio - you're joining a community that has each other's backs.

### You Get All Aviation Services Anywhere
Submit flight plans from your cockpit. Pay for TieDown while you're still in the air. Get official weather updates in the middle of nowhere. Access NOTAMs without cell service. Your phone becomes your complete aviation services portal.

### You Get Official, Reliable Weather
No more wondering if that weather app is current or accurate. Alaska DOT&PF curates official NOAA data and pushes it directly to your device. You get the same weather the state uses for official decisions.

### You See Traffic Without Cell Service
Your phone shows nearby aircraft even when you're 200 miles from the nearest cell tower. ADS-B traffic awareness through the mesh network means you always know who's around you.

### You Get Automatic Emergency Protection
If something goes wrong, your phone automatically broadcasts your location and emergency status across the network. Other pilots relay it until it reaches help. No fumbling for emergency beacons or satellite devices.

### You Use What You Already Know
Your iPhone or Android works exactly like it always has. The SkyBridge app feels familiar because it uses the interface patterns you already know. No learning curve, no training manuals.

### You Get Coverage Where Nothing Else Works
Cell towers don't reach the mountains. Satellites get blocked by terrain. But the [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org) mesh network bounces signals from pilot to pilot until they reach you. Coverage gets better in exactly the places where you need it most.

## Real-World Use Cases

### Weather Updates in Remote Areas
**Scenario**: You're flying from Bethel to Aniak and need current weather at your destination.

**Traditional method**: Call FSS on radio if you're in range. No updates once airborne. Weather can change dramatically.

**With SkyBridge**: Automatic weather updates from the mesh network. PIREPs from pilots ahead of you. Real-time conditions at your destination.

### Search and Rescue Activation  
**Scenario**: Your aircraft experiences engine failure in a remote area.

**Traditional method**: ELT activation, maybe detected by satellite. Hours before search begins. Large search area to cover.

**With SkyBridge**: Immediate beacon through mesh network. Last known position relayed by other aircraft. Search area reduced to less than 1 mile radius.

### Missing Critical Radio Traffic
**Scenario**: You're flying through a mountain pass and miss a critical weather update on VHF.

**Traditional method**: Hope someone repeats the information. Often, critical information is said only once.

**With SkyBridge**: Base stations capture all VHF transmissions and convert to text. You see exactly what was said, even if you were out of VHF range.

### Remote Airport Operations
**Scenario**: Landing at a remote strip with no services or communication.

**Traditional method**: Hope the runway is clear. No way to pay for services. Limited weather information.

**With SkyBridge**: Get runway conditions from other pilots. Pay for TieDown through the app. Access local weather and NOTAMs.
