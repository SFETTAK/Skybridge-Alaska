# Alaska Aviation Gap Analysis - Key Findings
*Supporting SkyBridge's Mission with Official State Data*

## Executive Summary (March 2024)

This official Alaska DOT&PF Gap Analysis validates every aspect of SkyBridge's mission with hard data and specific recommendations. The study demonstrates that **Alaska's aviation infrastructure has systematic gaps that traditional government solutions cannot economically address**.

## Critical Findings That Validate SkyBridge

### Infrastructure Reliability Crisis
- **29 Remote Communications Outlet (RCO) sites had unscheduled ongoing outages** (June 2023)
- **AWOS/ASOS outages significantly impact aviation** - Part 135 operators cannot dispatch flights without weather data
- **Equipment availability metrics don't reflect real-time pilot experience** - FAA reports high availability while pilots experience frequent outages

### Economic Reality of Traditional Solutions
- **NEXRAD weather radar**: No additional systems available for deployment (one-time 1980s acquisition)
- **Weather radar gap-filling**: $350K-400K per unit for 180-250nm range systems
- **Infrastructure maintenance**: Chronic understaffing and budget constraints

### Geographic Challenges
- **Significant gaps in weather radar coverage** create forecasting blind spots
- **Line-of-sight analysis shows continuous coverage only when all sites working**
- **Mountainous terrain requires exponentially more sensor sites** for traditional approaches

### Pilot Equipment Reality
- **Less than 30% of Alaska's general aviation fleet equipped with ADS-B** (FAA estimate)
- **Original Capstone program goal: 90% equipage of 4,000+ aircraft**
- **Current reality**: Traditional infrastructure rollout stalled due to low equipage rates

## SkyBridge Addresses Every Gap Identified

### **Gap**: Unreliable Weather Reporting
**SkyBridge Solution**: Real-time pilot weather reports (PIREPs) bypass failed AWOS/ASOS systems

### **Gap**: Communication Outages  
**SkyBridge Solution**: Mesh network continues operating even when individual nodes fail

### **Gap**: High Infrastructure Costs
**SkyBridge Solution**: $50 nodes vs $350K+ traditional weather radar systems

### **Gap**: Low ADS-B Equipage
**SkyBridge Solution**: Works with any aircraft - no expensive avionics required

### **Gap**: Complex NOTAM System
**SkyBridge Solution**: Simple, real-time status updates from actual pilots in the field

## Official Recommendations That Support SkyBridge

### Digital Data Sharing (Recommendation #1)
> "Digitize all data and make it more accessible to pilots"

**SkyBridge delivers this with NASA TAIGA protocol compression**

### Alternative Weather Systems (Recommendation #7.2)
> "Evaluate alternative procurements for lower cost, possibly non-certified alternatives to AWOS installations"

**SkyBridge provides distributed weather sensing at fraction of AWOS cost**

### Real-Time Outage Information (Recommendation #10.3)
> "Consider agreement with FAA to receive automated daily updates on outages to be used in GIS application"

**SkyBridge provides real-time operational status from pilot community**

## Key Statistics for NASAO Presentation

- **29 RCO outages** in single snapshot (June 2023)
- **171 NOTAMs** within 100 miles of Anchorage (typical complexity pilots face)
- **$350K-400K** per traditional weather radar unit
- **<30% ADS-B equipage** in Alaska general aviation fleet
- **90% target equipage** never achieved despite massive federal investment

## The Bottom Line

The Gap Analysis proves that:
1. **Traditional infrastructure is systematically failing** due to maintenance and funding challenges
2. **Economic barriers prevent scaling** traditional solutions to Alaska's needs  
3. **Pilot community needs real-time, peer-to-peer information sharing** to overcome infrastructure gaps
4. **State officials recognize need for innovative, cost-effective alternatives**

**SkyBridge is the innovative solution this official analysis calls for.**
