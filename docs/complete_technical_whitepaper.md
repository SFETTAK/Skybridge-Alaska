# Project SkyBridge - Complete Technical Whitepaper
*Revolutionizing Aviation Communication with Meshtastic*

## 1. Executive Summary

Project SkyBridge is a resilient, low-cost communication system designed to address the chronic aviation safety gaps in Alaska's remote airspace. Leveraging open-source Meshtastic technology and LoRa-based mesh networking, SkyBridge enables general aviation (GA) pilots to access real-time situational awareness data—without relying on satellite or cellular infrastructure.

Developed in response to infrastructure gaps outlined in the Alaska Aviation Gap Analysis and aligned with FAA Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) and safety initiatives such as FAASI and the Don Young Aviation Safety Initiative, SkyBridge provides a scalable, decentralized solution that supports:

- **Live NOTAMs and weather alerts**
- **ADS-B relay and visibility tools** for nearby traffic
- **Search and Rescue (SAR) beaconing and check-ins**
- **Voice-to-text radio transcription** for inaccessible VHF zones
- **Self-healing, peer-to-peer communication** across airborne and ground nodes

**SkyBridge is not a replacement for ADS-B or commercial tracking systems.** Instead, it fills a critical last-mile gap—offering supplemental coverage where existing FAA infrastructure either does not reach or frequently fails.

With a **unit cost under $50, no recurring fees**, and support for solar-powered repeater nodes, SkyBridge offers unmatched affordability and rapid deployment potential. **Current prototype deployments have proven mesh viability at altitude with over 50 miles of transmission range** between aircraft and repeaters.

## 2. The Problem: Infrastructure Gaps and Aviation Risk

Alaska has one of the most aviation-dependent populations in the United States, with general aviation serving as primary transportation for remote communities. Yet despite this reliance, the state suffers from chronic communication infrastructure gaps, contributing to a disproportionately high rate of Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) incidents.

### Critical Statistics
- **Alaska pilots are 36 times more likely to die** than the average U.S. worker
- **Coverage gaps in RCOs, AWOS/ASOS, and ADS-B** create large "dead zones"
- **FAA Gap Analysis identifies frequent system outages** and limited real-time data visibility
- **High equipment costs deter adoption** of satellite alternatives

### The Missing Middle
These challenges reveal a clear need for a **low-cost, pilot-centered solution** that:
- Provides basic safety communications without satellites or cell towers
- Enables self-deployable infrastructure (solar repeater nodes)
- Offers peer-to-peer redundancy that strengthens with user adoption

**SkyBridge fills this "missing middle"** as a last-mile safety network that complements FAA infrastructure.

## 3. System Architecture

SkyBridge operates on a multi-layer mesh framework with three core node types:

### Node Types

#### Airborne Nodes (Pilot Devices)
- **Function**: Transmit location, status messages, receive alerts
- **Range**: 20–50 miles line-of-sight at altitude
- **Power**: Battery-powered or USB-powered
- **Interface**: Mobile device dashboard UI

#### Ground-Based Airport Nodes
- **Function**: Persistent mesh anchors; rebroadcast NOTAMs, weather, traffic
- **Power**: Wall-powered or solar-battery combo
- **Placement**: Rooftop or mast-mounted with high-gain antennas

#### High-Altitude Gateway/Repeater Nodes
- **Function**: Long-range bridges between disconnected mesh clusters
- **Features**: Ruggedized, solar-powered, high-gain antenna
- **Use Case**: Link air corridors (Bethel-Emmonak, Rainy Pass-Anchorage)

### Technology Stack
- **Hardware**: Meshtastic-compatible LoRa radios (RAK4631, Heltec V3, LilyGO T-Echo)
- **Firmware**: Meshtastic open-source with custom aviation modules
- **Protocol**: JSON and TAIGA ASN.1 encoding for efficient data transmission

## 5. Competitive Advantage

| Feature | **SkyBridge** | Garmin inReach | ForeFlight |
|---------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| **Works Offline** | ✅ Fully offline mesh | ✅ Satellite-based | ❌ Needs cell/WiFi |
| **Cost** | 💲 ~$50 one-time, no subscription | 💸 High upfront + monthly fees | 💲 Subscription + data plan |
| **Mesh Network** | ✅ Community-powered | ❌ Point-to-satellite only | ❌ Not mesh capable |
| **Weather & NOTAMs** | ✅ Pushed over mesh | ⚠️ Limited presets | ✅ When online only |
| **Emergency Use** | ✅ Broadcasts over local mesh | ✅ SOS + location | ❌ No offline capability |
| **Scalability** | ✅ **Grows stronger with users** | ❌ One-to-one usage | ❌ Limited by infrastructure |

## 6. FAA Alignment and Regulatory Compliance

### FAASI Alignment
SkyBridge directly addresses FAA Alaska Aviation Safety Initiative objectives:
- Increased weather/NOTAM availability in rural areas
- Real-time aircraft position tracking and communication redundancy
- Improved pilot situational awareness during critical flight phases

### Don Young Alaska Aviation Safety Initiative
Congressional reauthorization (House Section 510) targets:
- High-impact rural safety solutions
- Demonstrated reductions in SAR delays and CFIT risk
- Transparent performance tracking via dashboards

### Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Integration
- Broadcasting digitally encoded NOTAMs using TAIGA ASN.1 format
- Operating independently of cellular/satellite infrastructure
- Supporting both GA and AAM operations in mixed-use airspace

### Regulatory Compliance
- **FCC Part 15, Class B compliant** - 902–928 MHz ISM band
- **No licensing required** for aircraft or fixed-location use
- **Non-interfering** with FAA-controlled radio systems

## 7. Real-World Use Cases

### Remote Flight Corridor Coverage: Bethel to Emmonak
**Gap**: ADS-B and RCO outages common; limited radar below 5,000 ft  
**Solution**: SkyBridge relay nodes ensure check-ins reach DOT, pilots, FSS

### Mountain Pass Navigation: Rainy Pass and Mystic Pass
**Gap**: No reliable weather updates mid-pass; CFIT accidents in whiteout conditions  
**Solution**: Solar-powered repeater broadcasts localized weather directly into mesh

### Emergency SAR Relay
**Gap**: Downed aircraft in radar-dead zones rely on delayed ELT pings  
**Solution**: Crash beacons transmit location via mesh until rescue arrives

## 8. Cost-Efficiency Analysis

| Solution Type | Cost | Recurring Fees | Coverage Model |
|---------------|------|----------------|----------------|
| ADS-B GBT Site | $200,000+ | Moderate | Centralized, tower-based |
| VHF RCO Tower | $100,000–250,000+ | High | Limited line-of-sight |
| Satellite SAR Beacon | $300–500 device | $150+/yr | Uplink-only, no relay |
| **SkyBridge Node** | **$50–100** | **None** | **Peer-powered mesh** |
| **Solar Repeater** | **$300–600** | **None** | **Renewable, low-maintenance** |

**10x to 50x cost advantage** over traditional FAA infrastructure for low-altitude communication and data relay.
