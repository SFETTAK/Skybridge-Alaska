# SkyBridge Alaska - Media Coverage & Key Statistics

## Washington Post Coverage (October 14, 2014)
**"Alaska's outdated maps make flying a peril, but a high-tech fix is slowly gaining ground"**  
*By Lori Montgomery*

### Key Statistics from the Article:
- **Alaska pilots are 36 times as likely to die as the average U.S. worker** (CDC)
- **Alaska has roughly six times as many pilots per capita** as the rest of the nation
- **Since 2008, 15 "controlled flight into terrain" crashes killed 16 people** and left seven seriously injured
- **Terrain mapping errors of 263+ feet** contributed to fatal crashes (Stack/Beane incident)
- **"Mars is better mapped than the state of Alaska"** - Steve Colligan, E-Terra mapping firm

### The Stack/Beane Tragedy - A Case Study:
> "Stack, 38, and Beane, 33, died on impact, leaving behind three small children. Ifsar later measured the final ridge 263 feet higher than Stack's GPS would have shown that day. The plane slammed into rock about 300 feet below the ridgeline, rescuers said â€” close enough to suggest the bad map may have made a difference."

### Expert Quotes Supporting SkyBridge's Mission:

**Steve Colligan, E-Terra Aviation Safety:**
> "I told them [FAA], this is not the same as the lower 48. You'll kill people here."

**Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell:**
> "There was a crucial four or five minutes where we didn't know where we were... I have lost 25 friends in plane crashes."

**Dr. James Eule (Survivor):**
> "He [Stack] was probably doing a really good job, because he navigated quite a ways in the clouds. If he had better tools, maybe he would still be around."

### The Infrastructure Problem:
> "Alaska, it turns out, has never been mapped to modern standards. While the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is constantly refining its work in the lower 48 states, the terrain data in Alaska is more than 50 years old, much of it hand-sketched from black-and-white stereo photos shot from World War II reconnaissance craft and U-2 spy planes."

### Cost Reality:
- **$30 million** to finish mapping Alaska (2014 estimate)
- **$150 million per year** for nationwide 3D elevation program
- **$13 billion annually** in estimated economic benefits

### Why Traditional Solutions Haven't Worked:
> "We lobby. I'm sure Fugro lobbies. But as soon as they go to a CR [continuing resolution], you're screwed... We're talking about $30 million to finish the state. Thirty million dollars. When you consider all the benefits of the program, it seems like a no-brainer." - Ian Wosiski, Intermap Technologies

## How SkyBridge Addresses These Issues:

**The Washington Post Problem:** Terrain mapping errors kill pilots  
**SkyBridge Solution:** Real-time pilot reports bypass faulty government maps

**The Washington Post Problem:** Weather prediction failures in remote areas  
**SkyBridge Solution:** Peer-to-peer weather sharing from actual pilots

**The Washington Post Problem:** $30M+ government mapping programs stuck in budget gridlock  
**SkyBridge Solution:** $50 community-operated nodes, no federal dependency

**The Washington Post Problem:** "GPS is no good if it only covers four blocks downtown"  
**SkyBridge Solution:** Mesh network extends coverage across remote Alaska

*This 2014 article validates every aspect of SkyBridge's mission and demonstrates why traditional government solutions have failed to solve Alaska's aviation crisis.*
