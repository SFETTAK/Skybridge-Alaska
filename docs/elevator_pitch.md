# SkyBridge Alaska - Elevator Pitch for NASAO 2025

## 30-Second Version
*"Alaska pilots are dying at 36 times the national rate because they can't get weather updates in remote areas. We're fixing this with $50 mesh radios that let pilots share critical safety data peer-to-peer. No satellites, no subscriptions, just pilots helping pilots. Alaska DOT is piloting it now."*

## 60-Second Version (With Washington Post Credibility)
*"The Washington Post investigated Alaska's aviation crisis and found that Mars is literally better mapped than Alaska. Terrain mapping errors of 263+ feet are killing pilots - like Alex Stack and Aric Beane, who died when their GPS showed a ridge 263 feet lower than reality.*

*Government solutions are stuck in budget gridlock - $30 million just to finish mapping Alaska. We built a different approach: $50 mesh radios using NASA's TAIGA protocol that let pilots share real-time weather, terrain warnings, and emergency beacons peer-to-peer.*

*Alaska DOT is piloting it now. Montana, Idaho, Wyoming - you have the same terrain challenges. Same pilot fatality rates. This works without federal dependency, without recurring costs, and it's ready for multi-state deployment."*

## Key Statistics to Memorize
- **36x** - Alaska pilot fatality rate vs. average US worker
- **$50** - Cost per SkyBridge node
- **$200K+** - Cost per traditional ground station
- **263 feet** - Terrain mapping error that killed Stack/Beane
- **80%** - Data compression achieved by NASA TAIGA protocol
- **15 crashes** - "Controlled flight into terrain" since 2008 (16 dead, 7 injured)

## Compelling Quotes from Washington Post
- *"Mars is better mapped than the state of Alaska"* - Steve Colligan, E-Terra
- *"If he had better tools, maybe he would still be around"* - Dr. James Eule, crash survivor
- *"I have lost 25 friends in plane crashes"* - Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell

## Target States (Mountain/Rural Aviation)
**Tier 1:** Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico  
**Tier 2:** Maine, Michigan UP, Minnesota, North Dakota  
**Tier 3:** Washington, Texas, Florida

## Questions They'll Ask & Answers

**"Is this legal?"**
- FCC Part 15 ISM band compliance
- FAA allows supplemental (non-primary) navigation aids
- No regulatory barriers

**"Who pays for it?"**
- $50 nodes: States/airports/pilot communities
- No recurring costs
- Commercial licenses fund development

**"How is this different from ADS-B?"**
- Works below radar coverage
- Includes weather/NOTAMs
- Bidirectional communication
- Community operated

**"What about liability?"**
- Supplemental information only
- Pilot decision making unchanged
- Similar to flight service radio

## Success Metrics for NASAO
- 3+ states express interest
- 10+ contacts collected  
- 1+ state commits to pilot program
- Media coverage opportunity
