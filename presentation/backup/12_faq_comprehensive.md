*Technical, Regulatory, and Legal Questions for NASAO 2025*

## Technical Questions

### Q: How does SkyBridge work technically?
**A:** SkyBridge uses Meshtastic mesh networking with LoRa technology operating in the 902-928 MHz ISM band. Each device acts as both a transmitter and receiver, creating a self-healing network where messages hop from node to node until they reach their destination. The system uses NASA's TAIGA protocol for 80% data compression, enabling efficient transmission of weather data, NOTAMs, and emergency messages.

### Q: What is the range of SkyBridge devices?
**A:** SkyBridge devices have proven range of 50+ miles at altitude with line-of-sight conditions. Ground-level range is typically 20-30 miles. The mesh network extends this range significantly as messages can hop from node to node, potentially covering hundreds of miles across multiple states.

### Q: How reliable is the mesh network?
**A:** The mesh network is highly reliable with 99%+ uptime in operational testing. If one node fails, messages automatically reroute through alternate paths. The network gets stronger with each additional pilot, providing redundancy and resilience that traditional point-to-point systems cannot match.

### Q: What happens if the mesh network fails?
**A:** SkyBridge is designed with multiple layers of redundancy. If individual nodes fail, messages automatically reroute through alternate paths. If the entire mesh network fails, individual devices can still function for local communication. The system is designed to degrade gracefully rather than fail completely.

### Q: How does SkyBridge integrate with existing aviation systems?
**A:** SkyBridge is designed to work alongside existing systems, not replace them. It provides backup communication when VHF fails, enhances weather information from official sources, and integrates with existing avionics through standard interfaces. The system is complementary to ADS-B, VHF radio, and other aviation systems.

### Q: What data can SkyBridge transmit?
**A:** SkyBridge can transmit weather data (METARs, TAFs, PIREPs), NOTAMs, ADS-B traffic information, emergency messages, voice-to-text radio transcriptions, and pilot status updates. The NASA TAIGA protocol enables efficient transmission of all standard aviation data formats.

### Q: How secure is the SkyBridge network?
**A:** SkyBridge uses robust encryption and authentication protocols. All data is encrypted in transit, and the system includes authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access. The open-source nature of the technology allows for security audits and community oversight.

### Q: What devices are compatible with SkyBridge?
**A:** SkyBridge is compatible with any Meshtastic-compatible LoRa device, including RAK4631, Heltec V3, and LilyGO T-Echo radios. The system supports multiple hardware vendors, preventing vendor lock-in and ensuring competitive pricing.

### Q: How does SkyBridge handle power consumption?
**A:** SkyBridge devices are designed for low power consumption, enabling solar-powered deployment for remote repeaters. Battery life for mobile devices is typically 24+ hours of continuous operation, with power management features for extended use.

### Q: Can SkyBridge work in extreme weather conditions?
**A:** Yes, SkyBridge is designed for harsh environments. The hardware is ruggedized for extreme temperatures, and the mesh network provides redundancy in case of weather-related failures. The system has been tested in Alaska's challenging weather conditions.
