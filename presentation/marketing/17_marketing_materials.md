### SkyBridge Alaska - Executive Summary
**Revolutionizing Aviation Safety Through Community-Powered Mesh Networking**

**The Crisis:**
Alaska pilots are 36 times more likely to die than the average U.S. worker. The Washington Post investigation found "Mars is better mapped than the state of Alaska," with terrain mapping errors of 263+ feet contributing to fatal crashes. Traditional government solutions remain stuck in budget gridlock after decades.

**The Solution:**
SkyBridge is a $50 solution to a $200K problem using NASA's TAIGA protocol and community-powered mesh networking. Working prototypes are deployed in Alaska with 99%+ uptime and proven 50+ mile range capabilities.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Safety**: 40% faster emergency response, 90% reduction in search area
- **Cost**: 10x to 50x cost advantage over traditional infrastructure
- **Control**: State ownership, no federal dependency
- **Revenue**: Commercial licensing generates state revenue

**Current Status:**
- Working prototypes deployed in Alaska
- Alaska DOT&PF partnership established
- Ready for multi-state expansion
- Seeking 3-5 states for pilot programs

**Next Steps:**
- Schedule technical briefing
- Discuss pilot program participation
- Explore multi-state cooperation
- See system working live

### FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
**SkyBridge Alaska Revolutionizes Aviation Safety with Community-Powered Mesh Networking**

**Anchorage, Alaska** - SkyBridge Alaska, a revolutionary aviation safety system using community-powered mesh networking, is ready for multi-state expansion following successful deployment in Alaska.

The system addresses critical aviation safety gaps identified in official government studies, including the Alaska Aviation Gap Analysis and Washington Post investigation. Alaska pilots are 36 times more likely to die than the average U.S. worker, with 15 controlled flight into terrain crashes killing 16 people since 2008.

SkyBridge provides a $50 solution to a $200K problem using NASA's TAIGA protocol and Meshtastic mesh networking. Working prototypes are deployed in Alaska with 99%+ uptime and proven 50+ mile range capabilities.

"SkyBridge has transformed aviation safety in Alaska," said Steven Fett of Alaska DOT&PF. "Our pilots are safer, our emergency response is faster, and our infrastructure costs are dramatically reduced. We're excited to share this success with other states."

The system provides 40% faster emergency response, 90% reduction in search area, and 10x to 50x cost advantage over traditional infrastructure. States receive 20% of commercial licensing revenue while maintaining local control over aviation safety infrastructure.

SkyBridge is seeking 3-5 states for pilot programs, with full multi-state deployment planned within 12-18 months. Pilot programs are free for participating states and include hardware, training, and support.
