## Slide 4: ADS-B Equipage Crisis

### Content
**ADS-B Implementation Failure:**
- **<30%** of Alaska's general aviation fleet equipped with ADS-B
- **Original Capstone program goal: 90% equipage** of 4,000+ aircraft
- **Current reality**: Traditional infrastructure rollout stalled due to low equipage rates
- **Massive federal investment** with minimal pilot adoption

**Why Pilots Don't Equip:**
- **Expensive avionics** required ($5,000-15,000)
- **Limited coverage** in remote areas
- **No weather or NOTAM data** - position only
- **One-way communication** - no pilot input

**Result:**
- **90% target equipage never achieved** despite massive investment
- **Pilots still flying without modern safety systems**
- **Infrastructure built for equipment that doesn't exist**

### Visual Elements
- ADS-B equipage rate chart
- Cost comparison (equipment vs. benefits)
- Coverage map showing gaps

## Slide 5: Weather Infrastructure Gaps

### Content

- **Weather radar gap-filling**: $350K-400K per unit for 180-250nm range
- **Significant weather radar coverage gaps** create forecasting blind spots
- **Mountainous terrain requires exponentially more sensor sites**

**AWOS/ASOS Outages:**
- **Significantly impact aviation** - Part 135 operators cannot dispatch flights
- **Equipment availability metrics don't reflect pilot experience**
- **Frequent failures** in remote locations
- **No backup systems** when primary weather fails

**Economic Reality:**
- **$350K-400K per traditional weather radar unit**
- **Maintenance costs** in remote locations
- **Single points of failure** in critical systems

### Visual Elements

## Slide 6: Terrain Mapping Crisis

### Content
**"Mars is better mapped than the state of Alaska"**
*- Steve Colligan, E-Terra Aviation Safety*

**Mapping Data Problems:**

- **Much of it hand-sketched from black-and-white stereo photos**
- **Shot from World War II reconnaissance craft and U-2 spy planes**
- **Terrain mapping errors of 263+ feet** contributed to fatal crashes

**Government Response:**
- **$30 million** to finish mapping Alaska (2014 estimate)
- **$150 million per year** for nationwide 3D elevation program
- **$13 billion annually** in estimated economic benefits
- **Still stuck in budget gridlock** after decades

## Slide 7: NOTAM System Complexity

### Content
**NOTAM System Overload:**
- **171 NOTAMs** within 100 miles of Anchorage (typical complexity)
- **Pilots face overwhelming information overload**
- **Critical information buried in hundreds of NOTAMs**
- **No prioritization** of safety-critical information

**Communication Failures:**
- **VHF radio coverage gaps** in remote areas
- **Critical information said only once** on radio
- **Pilots miss essential weather and traffic updates**
- **No backup communication** when VHF fails

**Result:**
- **Pilots fly without critical information**
- **Increased risk of accidents**
- **Delayed emergency response**
- **System designed for lower 48, not Alaska**

## Slide 8: Economic Barriers to Solutions

### Content
**Traditional Infrastructure Costs:**
- **Weather radar units**: $350K-400K each
- **Ground stations**: $200K+ each
- **VHF RCO towers**: $100K-250K+ each
- **Maintenance**: Ongoing and expensive

**Government Budget Constraints:**
- **$30 million** to finish mapping Alaska
- **$150 million/year** for nationwide 3D elevation program
- **Federal funding delays** and continuing resolutions
- **State budgets** cannot afford traditional solutions

**"We're talking about $30 million to finish the state. Thirty million dollars. When you consider all the benefits of the program, it seems like a no-brainer."**
*- Ian Wosiski, Intermap Technologies*

**Result:**
- **Traditional solutions economically impossible** for rural states
- **Infrastructure gaps persist** for decades
- **Pilots continue to die** from preventable causes

### Visual Elements
- Cost comparison chart
- Budget constraint visualization
- Economic impact diagram
- Expert quote prominently displayed

### Speaker Notes
- "Traditional infrastructure is too expensive for rural states"
- "Even when the economic benefits are clear, government solutions get stuck"

**The Gap:**
- **Pilots need reliable communication** in remote areas
- **States need affordable infrastructure** solutions
- **Emergency services need** faster response capabilities
- **No solution exists** that addresses all these needs
