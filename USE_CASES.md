# Use Cases for SkyBridge Alaska

## Primary Use Cases

### 1. Weather Updates in Remote Areas
**Scenario**: Pilot flying from Bethel to Aniak needs current weather at destination

**Traditional Method**: 
- Call FSS on radio (if in range)
- No updates once airborne
- Weather can change dramatically

**With SkyBridge**:
- Automatic weather updates from mesh network
- PIREPs from pilots ahead
- Real-time conditions at destination

### 2. Search and Rescue Activation
**Scenario**: Aircraft experiences engine failure in remote area

**Traditional Method**:
- ELT activation (maybe detected by satellite)
- Hours before search begins
- Large search area

**With SkyBridge**:
- Immediate beacon through mesh
- Last known position relayed by other aircraft
- Search area reduced to <1 mile radius

### 3. Mountain Pass Navigation
**Scenario**: Flying through Rainy Pass with deteriorating weather

**Traditional Method**:
- No weather updates in pass
- Blind decision making
- Multiple CFIT accidents annually

**With SkyBridge**:
- Weather cam summaries from pass entrance
- Reports from aircraft that just transited
- Go/no-go decision before commitment

### 4. Runway Condition Reporting
**Scenario**: Landing at unattended airport after freezing rain

**Traditional Method**:
- No information available
- Risky landing attempt
- Potential runway excursion

**With SkyBridge**:
- Previous pilot reports: "Runway iced over, landed in grass"
- Real-time conditions
- Informed decision to divert

### 5. Traffic Awareness Below Radar
**Scenario**: Multiple aircraft converging on fishing lodge

**Traditional Method**:
- No radar coverage below 5,000ft
- See-and-avoid only
- Near misses common

**With SkyBridge**:
- All aircraft visible on mesh
- Collision alerts
- Coordinated arrivals

## Secondary Use Cases

### 6. Community Coordination
- "Anyone heading to Nome today? Need to share fuel costs"
- "Medical evacuation inbound, please clear airspace"
- "Moose on runway at Talkeetna"

### 7. Flight Following for Small Operators
- Part 135 operators track their fleet
- Automatic position updates
- Reduced workload for dispatch

### 8. Weather Trend Analysis
- Historical data collection
- Identify problem areas
- Improve forecasting models

### 9. Training and Education
- Student pilots receive real-time mentorship
- Experienced pilots share knowledge
- Community-based safety culture

### 10. Emergency Weather Diversions
- "Anchorage just went IFR, divert to Wasilla"
- Real-time alternate airport conditions
- Coordinated emergency response

## Economic Impact

### Cost Savings
- **Reduced accidents**: Each prevented accident saves $1-5M
- **Fuel savings**: Better routing saves 10-15% fuel
- **Time savings**: Fewer weather delays
- **Infrastructure**: $50 nodes vs $200K ground stations

### Revenue Generation
- **Commercial licenses**: Large operators pay for service
- **Tourism enhancement**: Safer flights attract more visitors
- **Economic development**: Better access to remote communities
